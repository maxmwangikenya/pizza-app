          Welcome to Maxi's Pizzeria!

          Founded in 2020, Maxi's Pizzeria is a slice of heaven nestled in the heart of Gachie. Our journey began with a simple passion for creating the perfect pizzaâ€”a place where friends and family could gather to enjoy delicious, handcrafted pies made from the freshest ingredients.

          At Maxi's, we believe that every pizza tells a story. From our signature Margherita to our adventurous seasonal specials, each creation is crafted with love and a dash of creativity. Our warm, inviting atmosphere makes it the ideal spot for casual dining, celebrations, or just a quick bite.

          Join us at Maxi's Pizzeria, where every meal is a celebration of flavor, community, and the art of pizza-making. Come taste the difference!
